## Full Stack App:

I made an attempt to create a full stack application, but unfortunately, I was unable to establish a connection between the front end and backend. However, I am currently learning about authentication and how to connect a full stack application. For the backend, I utilized Express js and for the database, I implemented Sequelize with either SQLite or PostgreSql.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
